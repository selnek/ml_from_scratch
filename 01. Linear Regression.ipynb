    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a simple and widely used algorithm for regression analysis, where the goal is to predict a continuous value based on the values of one or more input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, which is used to predict the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that describes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-fit line is determined by finding the values of the slope and intercept that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the actual and predicted values. This process is also known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best-fit line is determined, it can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable. This prediction is made by plugging the value of the independent variable into the equation of the best-fit line."
